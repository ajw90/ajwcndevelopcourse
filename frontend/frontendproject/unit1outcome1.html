            <p>
                My name is Andrew Winters; I am 29 years old at the time of writing, and I am currently 
                attending the 3-week Develop Course at Code Nation in Chester.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have some previous experience of programming, having developed an interest in the subject 
                after finding a copy of the book, The C Programming Language, in a charity shop in 2008 
                (I still have it). In time I progressed to looking into various other programming topics, 
                particularly web development, and I do still have some of the - perhaps slightly outdated - 
                work from that time period. However, due to work commitments, I let this interest fall 
                somewhat into the background.   
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing that did endure from this time period is my use of the Linux operating system at 
                home, and I like to think that this has kept my IT skills somewhat more up-to-date than they 
                might otherwise be, since using this OS day-to-day does occasionally require some in-depth 
                problem solving.      
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, whilst working at Chester Jobcentre near the end of a fixed-term contract, I came to 
                learn of Code Nation through their admissions team, who were visiting the site to talk to 
                staff and customers about the courses they offer. I took a look at their website and concluded 
                that taking this course would be an excellent step in the right direction. I would like, at 
                this point in my life, to start a career, ideally doing something that I have an interest in; 
                I enjoy coding and problem solving generally, and I relish the idea of developing usable 
                products whilst continuously learning and updating my skills within the industry.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I have enjoyed the course thus far; the syllabus has allowed me to rekindle my disused coding 
                skills and learn about industry-specific collaborative tools; I feel that this course has 
                been very beneficial in that it hasn’t taught coding alone but also the other equally vital 
                skills (research, digital teamwork, etc) required in modern development; I hope, on 
                completing this course, to continue learning with the organisation through their Master Course.

            Describing the purpose of IT in modern business
        </h3>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>
                The purpose of IT in modern business is to leverage the advantages of computer technology to 
                enhance efficiency, scalability, and productivity, whilst reducing the costs entailed by more 
                traditional clerical processes [2, 3]. IT has, over the last few decades, assumed a pivotal 
                role in the modern business environment [1]; irrespective of how small or traditional a 
                company may be, they will generally have to invest in IT infrastructure just to remain 
                competitive and relevant [4]. IT will usually be used in all areas of a modern business, 
                from engaging with customers to managing resources both human and logistical. Mindful of 
                its public profile, a business will generally seek to maintain a presence on the web, both 
                through its own website/web application and social media. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Email and instant messaging platforms have massively increased the easy exchange of data 
                and improved the communicative efficiency of teams and organisations. Databases and 
                cloud storage have dramatically reduced the reliance on traditional, spatially 
                burdensome physical data storage. These are just a few examples of how IT has become 
                virtually inseparable from modern business [1, 2].

            Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – 
            what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
        </h3>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>
                Digital projects, especially those involving multiple inputs - ie, most in the real world - can 
                grow large and very complex very quickly; therefore, beyond the technological know-how 
                required for actually constructing software, it is imperative that a team thinks carefully 
                about how it plans and organises its project [6] and how communication and task management 
                is handled during its completion, so long as any planning is done efficiently and doesn’t 
                over-dominate developers’ time [6]. Stand up meetings help teams to strike this balance 
                effectively; they are characterised by their relative brevity and tend to maintain a simple 3-way focus: “what did each team member do yesterday?”, “what will they do today?”, and “what, if any, obstacles/blockers are they dealing with right now?” [7].
            </p>
            <p>
                The team needs to understand what the client wants and what problems this 
                requires them to solve; they must have some high-level idea of how best to 
                structure the project and delegate tasks to handle this in a reasonable 
                timeframe [1]. Trello [2] is an approachable and effective tool for monitoring 
                progress interactively, as it can be updated quickly and flexibly; used in 
                conjunction with Kanban (the division of tasks into the categories, “to-do”, 
                “doing”, and “done”) [3], it can massively increase the effectiveness of 
                development teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                Version control using software like Git [4] is also very important for tracking change in 
                large projects; this allows teams to work on multiple sub-parts of a single project 
                simultaneously in sandboxed isolation from the main implementation (branching [4]), into 
                which changes can subsequently be integrated after successful development and testing. This 
                permits any mistakes to be reversed in a safe manner and allows for snapshots of the project 
                to be made at various phases of development; these can be reverted back to in the future 
                should the need arise [5].

            <p>
                When building the website, I will make continuous use of the Trello board [2] which I 
                constructed at the beginning of the project to divide up tasks into different types and 
                sections. This task includes conducting research to answer questions relating to development 
                as a profession as well as a coding component which will involve writing a website using 
                HTML and CSS.

            <p>
                In order to give structure to the task and make it more manageable, I will use the Kanban [1] 
                principle (the division of tasks into the categories, “to-do”, “doing”, and “done”) to 
                separate tasks according to their current progress; I will use a system of coloured labels to 
                further distinguish task cards according to type: ie, coding, learning, research, answering 
                questions, etc. In this way, I will take a diverse workload and render it more approachable; 
                the combined use of Trello and Kanban will help me to remain mindful of how on-track the 
                project is and whether there is any need to amend the pace or focus of work at any point.

            Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects

        </h3>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>
                There are a number of factors that can put at risk the success of an IT project. A lack of 
                clarity concerning the objectives of the project and inadequate communication between 
                clients, managers, and developers can lead to a mismatch between expectations and the end 
                product. Failure to provide realistic timescales and allocate the correct resources can have 
                the result that a developer team finds that it doesn’t have the capacity to meet deadlines 
                or lacks the technical expertise  or development tools required [1, 2].
            </p>
            <p>
                While it may be tempting to prioritise speed of development, proper testing is vital to 
                delivering working, bug-free software; if this is not done, a finished product may be 
                delivered which is superficially functional but fails in deployment, damaging the 
                reputation of the software provider responsible and potentially resulting in a breach of 
                contract [2]. Another potential point of failure which can sabotage the success of a project 
                from the very beginning is choosing technology which does not suit the task required [3].

        <div class="answers">
            <p>
                The best tool for use in a given situation arises as a function of the problem to be solved 
                itself [3] and the available budget and technical resources. It is important to consider 
                whether the technology being proposed has proven effective in tackling similar problems 
                previously, whether there will be any financial cost for its use, and whether it is 
                compatible with the platforms being used in production and eventual deployment [1]. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to determine whether the technology will be performant given the 
                client’s expected requirements; if it is likely the project will require 
                alteration in future, it may be worth considering how the choice of technology 
                allows for scaling and extensibility. Another consideration is how widely used 
                and supported the technology is: is it likely, in the event of some unforeseen 
                issue emerging in the more distant future, that the client will be able to find 
                the expertise required to solve this issue? These are some of the questions 
                that would need considering before choosing which technology to go with [1].

                Were I required to make this decision, I would check what has been used successfully in the 
                past for similar problems, and I would attempt to balance appropriateness (eg, Python for 
                machine learning [2]) and requirements; whichever solution met the most criteria - and 
                entailed the least disadvantage - would then be selected.

            Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you 
            achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and 
            GitHub help with your codes version control.

                The technologies chosen for this task have each brought their own particular benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
                GitHub has provided a conveniently accessible place for storing completed work; using this 
                in tandem with Git itself, I have been able to take advantage of version control in 
                this project [1]; this ensures that only functioning code is integrated into the final 
                project and has made it possible to take snapshots of the project at various different 
                phases of development; should it be necessary, it is quite possible to revert to these 
                previous phases [2]. Trello has allowed me to break the whole project down into logical, 
                modular sub-tasks resulting in a much more manageable workload and assisted me in being 
                more conscious of the overall level of progress being made throughout [3].

                Visual Studio Code is the editor I have made use of during this project; it features a 
                number of useful attributes that have been a considerable help throughout: being able to 
                highlight text according to the language in use, to view the project’s file hierarchy in 
                a side panel, and to make use of an attached terminal view (which defaults to the project's 
                parent directory).

            Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does 
            GDPR impact digital projects?
        </h3>

                It is important for those who are creating software for anything besides personal use to bear 
                in mind the legal realities that pertain to development.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the production of software is done according to a contract, there are likely to 
                be SLAs (Service Level Agreements) specified concerning timescales, requirements, and 
                other client specifications; to be in breach of these can involve the business’ losing 
                money, clients, and vital prestige; serious enough breaches can be a legal matter, so 
                it is important for projects to be managed with a view to preventing this [1]. Another 
                concern is the use of licensed software in building the project; it can be very easy, 
                particularly given the increasing abundance of open-source resources available, to simply 
                assume that one can use them as one wishes; the reality is otherwise; it is important to 
                consider the usage rights specific to all digital technology used, giving necessary 
                credit and displaying licencing information where mandated [1].
            </p>
            <p>
                Europe’s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [4] involves developers in several 
                new considerations; though, in many ways, what it enforces has long been best practice. 
                These regulations apply not just within Europe, but to any instance in which the personal 
                data of EU citizens is handled [2]. When developing user-facing software, it is important 
                only to collect that information for which there is a genuine business need, to make clear 
                to the user the nature of this need, and to retain this data only for so long as the need 
                persists. This naturally has strong ramifications where data is gathered through cookies [5]; 
                where websites gather customer data in this and similar ways, they must make this known and 
                gain the consent of the customer before proceeding to do so [2, 6].
            </p>
            <p>
                Where personal data is being communicated through digital channels, it is important that 
                every measure available be taken to ensure that this is done in the most secure way 
                technologically possible, eg, using the HTTPS protocol instead of HTTP [3, 7].
