                Describing the purpose of IT in modern business
            </h4>
            <p>
                The purpose of IT in modern business is to leverage the advantages of computer technology to 
                enhance efficiency, scalability, and productivity, whilst reducing the costs entailed by more 
                traditional clerical processes [2, 3]. IT has, over the last few decades, assumed a pivotal 
                role in the modern business environment [1]; irrespective of how small or traditional a company 
                may be, they will generally have to invest in IT infrastructure just to remain competitive and 
                relevant [4]. IT will usually be used in all areas of a modern business, from engaging with 
                customers to managing resources both human and logistical. Mindful of its public profile, a 
                business will generally seek to maintain a presence on the web, both through its own website/web 
                application and social media.

                Email and instant messaging platforms have massively increased the easy exchange of data and 
                improved the communicative efficiency of teams and organisations. Databases and cloud storage 
                have dramatically reduced the reliance on traditional, spatially burdensome physical data 
                storage. These are just a few examples of how IT has become virtually inseparable from modern 
                business [1, 2].
